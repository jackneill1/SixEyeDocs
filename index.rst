SixEye Documentation
********************

Welcome to portal documentation for SixEye.

SixEye combines the management and control of products from multiple manufacturers into one portal, accessible in your web browser. What's more, this portal will carry your own branding and is available at your own Internet domain. Invite end users into any project site in your portal and grant them bespoke access with SixEye's granular permissions. Device management includes firmware and file upload, triggering, real time status, logs and more.

The following documentation is intended for existing SixEye users. For More information about the SixEye solution overall, please see `our website <https://sixeye.net/>`_.
