The User Interface in a SixEye :term:`portal` is designed to be minimalistic and simple to use.

On the left of the interface is the menu bar which is headed by the portals name and/or logo.

My Sites
========

Contains all of the Sites that you are a member of and have the appropriate permission to view. Clicking on a Site in the table will take you to that Site. Selecting the Site using the radio button to the left of the Site name will show addition actions.

Creating a Site
---------------

Simply click the 'Create site' button to add a new Site. A name will need to be provided. 

Deleting a Site
-----------------

- Select a Site by clicking the circle to left of the Site name
- Click 'Delete' in the toolbar

Any Sites deleted will have the devices in it disconnected from the :term:`portal` and all users and setting removed. This cannot be undone.

Users
=====

Contains a list of all the users who are visible to you across all Sites you are a User in.

Suspending a user
-----------------

- Select a user by clicking the circle to left of the users name
- Click 'Suspend' in the toolbar

Un-suspending a user can be achieved in the same way as described above.

A suspended user will not be able to login to the :term:`:term:`portal``. 

Permissions
===========

Contains the ability to change users permissions in a Site or :term:`portal` context. All users will be able to see the permissions of users whome they share a Site with and have the correct permissions to view. It is likely only certain users will be able to edit those permissions.

For more on permissions see the permissions_ section of this documentation.
